            <h2>Politics</h2>
            <p>Traditionally a kingdom, as the name suggests, the Kingdom of Hilfeir is currently led by a ruling council consisting of representatives from its four constituent city-states, as well as representatives from its smaller municipalities. The council is led by its president, selected by one of the member city-states on a rotating basis. The council has authority over the kingdom for national security, foreign policy, and trade policy. However, the council has only the Royal Guard to enforce security, as well as diplomatic and trade attaches at its disposal; in practice, each city-state is largely autonomous and enforces its own policies.</p>

            <h2>Demographics and Culture</h2>
            <p>Hilfeir is a metropolitan nation, with majority populations of humans and elves, as well as smaller populations of half-elves, dwarves, gnomes, half-orcs, and catfolk. Hilfeir culture is best described as industrious; as a detritus community, the Kingdom is surrounded by vast natural resources among the dangerous frontier of the Aetherwood greatforest floor. Many of the Kingdom's citizens are descendents of loggers, miners, fishers, and explorers who sought to tame the frontier and tap into its vast resources.</p>
